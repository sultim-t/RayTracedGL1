# RTGL1

***Work in progress***

RTGL1 is a library that simplifies the process of porting applications with fixed-function pipeline to *real-time path tracing*

It's achievable with hardware accelerated ray tracing, low sample per pixel count and utilizing denoising algorithms to improve the image quality by aggressively reusing spatio-temporal data.
